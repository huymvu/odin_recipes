<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Banh Mi is a Vietnamese sandwich that is made up of an odd sounding combination – crusty bread rolls smeared with
    pate, mayo, suspicious looking Asian ham, pickled vegetables, green onion, coriander/cilantro, a mighty wack of
    fresh chillies and drizzle of seasoning.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup julienned (2-inch matchsticks) daikon radish</li>
    <li>¼ cup julienned (2-inch matchsticks) carrots</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar</li>
    <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon hoisin sauce, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sriracha hot sauce, or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 crusty French sandwich roll</li>
    <li>4 ounces cooked pork roast, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 ounces smooth pate, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>6 thin spears English cucumber, diced</li>
    <li>6 thin slices jalapeno pepper, or more to taste</li>
    <li>¼ cup cilantro leaves</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Toss radish and carrot with seasoned rice vinegar in a bowl until well coated. Let sit until veggies become
        slightly limp, 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and set aside or refrigerate.</li>
    <li>Mix mayonnaise, hoisin sauce, and sriracha in a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Split French roll just enough so you can open it like a book. Pull out some of the bread from the top half to
        better accommodate the filling if desired.</li>
    <li>Spread the interior surfaces of roll liberally with mayonnaise mixture. Transfer roll, cut-side up, to the
        prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until warm and crisp with slightly browned edges, about 7 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place sliced pork, paté, pickled radish and carrot, cucumber, jalapeño, and cilantro leaves in warm roll. Cut in
        half to serve.</li>
