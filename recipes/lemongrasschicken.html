<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped lemongrass</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons light brown sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>

    <li>1 Â½ pounds chicken thighs, or more to taste, pounded to an even thickness</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix together canola oil, lemongrass, lemon juice, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and fish sauce in a glass bowl
        until sugar is dissolved; add chicken and turn to coat in marinade.</li>
    <li>Marinate chicken in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
    <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Remove chicken thighs from marinade; shake to remove excess. Discard remaining marinade.</li>
    <li>Cook chicken on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, 3 to 5 minutes per
        side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
